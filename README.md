# Project Name
> This project builds a Multiple Linear Regression Model.


## Table of Contents
* [General Info](#general-information)
1. Identify significant variables affecting bike demand.
2. Quantify the Variables in Total rentals
3. Support for business decision making by providing insights
* [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)
JUPYTER Notebook
* [Conclusions](#conclusions)
1. **Year (yr):** Bike demand increased significantly from 2018 to 2019.
2. **Temperature (temp):** Higher temperatures positively correlate with higher bike rentals.
3. **Season:** Fall and summer seasons show higher demand compared to spring.
4. **Weather:** Bad weather (rain/snow) negatively impacts demand.
5. **Working Day:** Demand differs between weekdays and weekends, showing commuter influence.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
BoomBikes, a US based Bike Sharing Company, face significant decline in the market.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
BoomBikes wants to unserdtand the below problems.
1. Which factors significantly affect the demand of the shared bikes.
2. How well these factors explained the overall demand.
3. How to use these factors and predict the future demand and make strategy.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `season` | Season (1: spring, 2: summer, 3: fall, 4: winter) |
| `yr` | Year (0: 2018, 1: 2019) |
| `mnth` | Month of the year (1–12) |
| `holiday` | Whether the day is a holiday |
| `weekday` | Day of the week |
| `workingday` | If day is neither weekend nor holiday |
| `weathersit` | Weather condition (1–4, categorical) |
| `temp`, `atemp`, `hum`, `windspeed` | Normalized weather-related features |
| `casual`, `registered` | Number of casual and registered users (dropped to prevent data leakage) |
| `cnt` | **Target variable** – total number of bikes rented per day |
